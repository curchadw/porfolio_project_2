# flatiron_sinatra_project
Welcome to my Flatiron School Sinatra project called the "Team Management System". This CMS application is designed for you to manage the roster of your sports team as well as scout other players in the league as well.

When trying to run the application, besure to do a bundle install first to load gems and other dependencies, then type in "shotgun" in the terminal.
