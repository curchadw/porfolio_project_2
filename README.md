## Installation

- You will fork from my repo and clone on to your system. 
- Once you clone and open it on your system, you will do a "bundle install" in your terminal terminal to install the required dependicies for it to run properly

## Usage
For now you will only be able to access from a local server. You will type "shotgun" in your terminal, and type in localhost:9393 in you browser. You will be able to create a user account, and log in. The application will provide html based forms for you to fill out and save information. There are delete and edit functionalities as well if you are adjusting or deleting players on your roster
